# ðŸ’³ Credit Risk Modeling â€“ JPMorgan Chase Virtual Experience

This project was completed as part of the **JPMorgan Chase Quantitative Research Virtual Experience** on Forage. It simulates real-world tasks faced by quantitative analysts in credit risk modeling, including data preprocessing, outlier handling, predictive modeling, and credit score bucketing.

##  Task Overview

### âœ… Task 1: Data Exploration and Forecasting
- Analyzed historical monthly natural gas prices (Oct 2020 â€“ Sep 2024).
- Built a forecast model using monthly seasonal averages to extrapolate prices for the next 12 months.
- Designed a function to estimate price given any future date.
- Visualized seasonality trends and future price forecasts.

### âœ… Task 2: Valuing a Natural Gas Storage Contract
- Created a pricing function to estimate the economic value of a storage contract using injected and withdrawn natural gas volumes.
- Included factors like monthly storage cost, capacity constraints, and market prices.
- Applied test cases to simulate contract value and validate strategy logic.

### âœ… Task 3: Credit Risk Prediction
- Explored and cleaned a loan dataset with borrower features and default indicators.
- Applied outlier handling (capping) and standardized numeric features.
- Built and compared three models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Gaussian Naive Bayes
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Used `GridSearchCV` and cross-validation to optimize performance.
- Evaluated models using ROC-AUC, confusion matrices, and test accuracy.

### âœ… Task 4: FICO Score Bucketing & Default Risk Profiling
- Transformed continuous `fico_score` into discrete credit bands using `KBinsDiscretizer` (quantile-based).
- Validated that each bucket had balanced records.
- Analyzed default rates across buckets and observed a clear inverse relationship between score and default likelihood.
- Visualized the distribution and risk profile of each segment.
